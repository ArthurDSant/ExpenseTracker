# Expense Tracker
This app is an expense tracker. With addition and removal of items and calculation of the total value. It's not a very complex project but it served well as an introduction to this Framwork that I still didn't know enough about to try something big. Despite that,
It was great for reinforcing my knowledge of Javascript in the parts that involve calculations and understanding better about this Framework.

## Learnings
The objective of this project from the beginning was to learn how to structure and organize an application in VUE.Js, which was successful. After this application I feel more confident in using this Framwork as a tool for a larger and more complex project in the future.
